        <h2>Never worked with a broker before?</h2>
        <p>Here’s what that actually means — and how it helps you.</p>

        <div class="trust-block reveal">
          <h3>From the dealership side to your side</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve spent time on the inside of the dealership world—on the sales side where every day is about moving units and
            protecting profit. That experience is exactly what I now use <strong>for</strong> buyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you walk in alone, you’re going up against a team that negotiates deals every day. Most buyers only do this every
            few years. That experience gap is where a lot of money and options can be lost.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trust-block reveal">
          <h3>What a broker actually does</h3>
          <p>
            As your broker, I’m not tied to one store. I compare multiple dealerships, use the same tools and structure they do,
            and then look for the best combination of price, payment, and terms for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You still pick up your vehicle from a dealership—but by the time you arrive, the numbers and structure have already
            been reviewed and discussed with someone who understands how those deals are put together.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trust-block reveal">
          <h3>Why this makes car buying easier</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of trying to guess which offer is fair or worrying about missing something in the paperwork, you have someone
            walking you through it. My goal is to make the process feel straightforward, calm, and clear—while getting you a
            deal that reflects what’s actually possible in the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short: the dealership focuses on their business. I focus on <strong>your</strong> outcome.
