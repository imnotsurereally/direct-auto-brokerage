            <p class="deal-highlight">
              Target: Mid–$300s/mo, sensible drive-offs, average-to-good credit.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              Bread-and-butter sedan when you want something that feels nicer than “basic transportation,” but you don’t
              want to be car-poor. I focus on clean builds without junk add-ons or fake “market adjustments.”
            </p>
            <p class="deal-note">
              Great for commuters and small families who just want a fair, boring payment that doesn’t surprise them.

            <p class="deal-highlight">
              Target: High–$300s to low–$400s/mo range with realistic drive-offs.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              Huge demand, lots of noise. Programs and inventory swing a ton month-to-month. I quietly shop multiple
              rooftops and structure it where the payment makes sense for your life, not just the ad.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-note">
              Great for families, active people, and anyone who wants SUV practicality without going huge on payment.

            <h3>2026 Mercedes C300 – “Luxury that still makes sense.”</h3>
            <p class="deal-highlight">
              Target: $700s–$800s/mo, depending on miles, equipment, and credit.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              I know how these are structured behind the curtain. The big win is getting a build that feels special
              without loading the payment with stuff you’ll never use.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-note">
              Ideal for people stepping into luxury for the first time or upgrading out of a mainstream sedan/SUV.

            <p class="deal-highlight">
              Target: Upper-$800s+ depending heavily on equipment and programs.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              These get expensive fast if you let the build run wild. I focus on packages that actually add value instead
              of just payment.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-note">
              Great for families or professionals who want luxury SUV comfort without feeling like they adopted a
              second rent payment.

            <p class="deal-highlight">
              Target: Mid-to-high $800s/mo ballpark in smart structures.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              Right month, right programs, right build — these can be way more approachable than people expect. The wrong
              build, and the payment jumps for no good reason.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-note">
              Perfect for people who want something that still feels sharp every time they drive it.

              Target: $800s/mo range depending on miles and incentives.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              X3 is a great all-rounder when built right. We avoid goofy wheels and options that look cool online but
              only exist to puff numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="deal-note">
              Great for people who want BMW driving feel but still need something practical day-to-day.

            </p>
            <p class="deal-story">
              A4 is where a lot of people realize they’re done with basic sedans. I look for builds with the right tech
              and comfort without turning it into a payment trap.
            </p>

              Q5 is often where families land when they want something nicer that still does Costco, school, and weekends.
